# node-express-mongo-website-blog
A blog website with node js, express js with edge templating engine and mongo db

After cloning the project go to the project directory in the console and please do "npm install" first.

Then go to Robo Mongo official website. The link is below ---
https://robomongo.org/

Here you can download Robo 3T according to your OS type.
This will help you to see your mongo db structures, values during project practise.

After downloading Robo 3T just unzip that and go to within that folder. You will get a folder named "bin".
Go to that and run "robo3t" and start your server.

Now come back to the project directory where you did npm install earlier in the console and just do "npm start".
Here you are ready to use the project.
Cheers!!!
